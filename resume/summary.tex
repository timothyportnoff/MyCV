\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}
Tech-savvy IT professional with an extensive background in computers \& computing. I thrive on hands-on work and enjoy reverse-engineering technology to understand exactly how it operates. This curiosity has driven me to build my own PC, repair my own devices, and configure my own servers from scratch. Technology is a puzzle, often complex and intimidating, but incredibly rewarding when everything clicks.

I recently obtained my A+ and am currently preparing for the Network+ on the CompTIA certification pathway. Seeking a position to leverage my technical and interpersonal skills in an environment that involves working on projects in-office or providing hands-on-support in the field.
