\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}
Tech-savvy IT professional with an extensive background in computers \& computing. I thrive on hands-on work and enjoy reverse-engineering technology to understand exactly how it operates. This curiosity has driven me to build my own PC, repair my own devices, and configure my own servers from scratch. Technology is a puzzle, often complex and intimidating, but incredibly rewarding when everything clicks.

I recently obtained my A+ and am committed to pursuing the CompTIA certification pathway. Currently I am preparing for the Network+.

Seeking a position to leverage my A+ certification in an environment that highlights my technical and interpersonal skills, whether that involves working on projects in-office or providing hands-on-support in the field. I look forward to speaking with you!
