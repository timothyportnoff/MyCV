		  \item {Developed and deployed a customer customer relationship management solution for the operations of a global Veterinarian company. To be compliant with PCI data security standards I had to register a FQDN, install TLS/SSL certs, and follow basic security measures such as disabling weak ciphers, disabling root access from the web, and banning brute-force ssh attempts. }
		  \item {Significantly sped up the invoicing and subscriptions by implementing a pipeline to automate the tedious process of assigning pet owners with Veterinarians by intercepting webhooks sent from the Stripe API.}
